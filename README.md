## ✨ What is RetroNote?

**RetroNote** is a lightweight, extensible, and beautiful note-taking app inspired by the golden era of the web — think Geocities, BBS terminals, and textured scrollbars. Designed for digital wanderers, hackers, writers, and memory hoarders, RetroNote lets you write, organize, and visualize your thoughts in a deeply personal way.

It’s like Notion and Obsidian had a kid raised by an old Angelfire forum.
